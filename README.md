Hi! My name is Ed, and I'm currently an ML engineer at [Hazy](https://hazy.com/) working on improving a privacy-preserving synthetic data generation platform for enterprise data analytics.

I studied at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), with an MSc in Statistics with Data Science at the [School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics), and a BSc in Computer Science at the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

I normally work with Python, mainly using it for machine learning or data related things, as well as any general purpose scripting, task automation or web development.
